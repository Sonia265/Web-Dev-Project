    <P>Lochquarry Outdoor Centre provides outdoor activities for young people aged 6–18.

        They have recently expanded the number of different activities that they offer
         and would like to have a website that informs potential visitors about all the 
         exciting activities that young people can take part in at Lochquarry.
